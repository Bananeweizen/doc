[[assertj-guava-3.3.0-InstanceOfAssertFactories]]
[.release-note-item]#Add `InstanceOfAssertFactories` to allow chain specific type assertions#

Add factories for `ByteSource`, `Multimap`, `Multiset`, `Optional` (guava) and `Table` to allow to chain specific type assertions from a value initially declared as a less specific type.

Let's start with the problem `asInstanceOf` is solving: in the following example we would like to call `Table` assertions but this is not possible since `value` is declared as an `Object` thus only `Object` assertions are accessible.
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// Given a Table declared as an Object
Object actual = HashBasedTable.<Integer, Integer, String> create();

// We would like to call Table assertions but this is not possible since value is declared as an Object
assertThat(actual).isEmpty(); // this does not compile !
----

Thanks to `asInstanceOf` we can now tell AssertJ to consider `value` as a `Table` in order to call `Table` assertions. +
To do so we need to pass an `InstanceOfAssertFactory` that can build a `TableAssert`, fortunately you don't have to write it, it is already available in `InstanceOfAssertFactories`!

[source,java,indent=0]
----
// Given a Table declared as an Object
Object actual = HashBasedTable.<Integer, Integer, String> create();

// With asInstanceOf, we switch to specific Table assertion by specifying the InstanceOfAssertFactory for Table
assertThat(value).asInstanceOf(InstanceOfAssertFactories.TABLE)
                 .isEmpty();
----

AssertJ verifies that the actual value is compatible with the assertions `InstanceOfAssertFactory` is going to give access to.

`InstanceOfAssertFactories` provides static factories for all types AssertJ provides assertions for, additional factories can be created with custom `InstanceOfAssertFactory` instances.
